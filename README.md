# FractalCL
A Java Mandelbrot application that uses OpenCL via the JOCL Java bindings [http://www.jocl.org/] 

This project is for learning OpenCL  It modifies the SimpleMandelbrot.cl kernel and calls it from my own swing application.  The application has intuitive controls and visual feedback for experimenting with changes to OpenCL stuff like workgroup size and , as well as strategy for generating the set itself. Future developments may include the addition of the Julia set and others, as well as possibly an OpenGL display mode.
